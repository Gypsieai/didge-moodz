# KINO-DB: CONTENT_DATABASE (Didgeri Boom)

## Core Conceptual Schema: "Earth to Algorithm"

This database acts as the structural foundation for **DIDGE_MOODZ**. It defines the exact content architecture formulated in the DIDGEMOODS Operational Manual. All content pushed by KINO-DB must align with this multi-tiered engagement strategy and apply the "Algorithmically Perfumed" pipeline.

### 1. The "Roots" Content (Hook & Discovery)

*Strategic Role:* To provide immediate visual and sonic impact to disrupt the passive "scrolling" state. Build the initial tribe.

* **Execution:** High-frequency snippets of raw performance in diverse locations (remote nature, urban centers, raw studios).
* **Cinematic Aesthetic:** **The "Earth to Algorithm" Aesthetic** — blending **Neon Purple highlights** with deep organic, earthy textures for immediate brand recognition.
* **Audio Treatment:** Raw, visceral acoustic sound prioritizing immediate impact.
* **A/B Hook Testing:** Agnostic testing (e.g., sensory "Listen to this vibration" vs. historical "The oldest wind instrument").
* **Hashtag Payload:** `#didgeridoo`, `#earthtoalgorithm`, `#primalenergy`, `#roots`, `#yidaki`

### 2. The "Process" Content (Trust & Authority)

*Strategic Role:* To demystify the craft, build expert authority, and transition viewers into active learners.

* **Execution:** Educational "behind-the-scenes" footage. Deep dives into the physical discipline of **circular breathing**, and the artisanal hunt for "finding the right timber." Serving as the bridge to long-form "Craft" documentaries.
* **Cinematic Aesthetic:** Documentary-style, clean, focused lighting. Close-ups on mouth/cheek mechanics for breathing, or hands carving wood.
* **Caption Style:** Instructional, step-by-step, authoritative but grounded.
* **Hashtag Payload:** `#circularbreathing`, `#didgemaking`, `#musiceducation`, `#woodworking`, `#didgeridooresonance`

### 3. The "Mood" Content (Wellness & Grounding)

*Strategic Role:* To position the brand as a powerful wellness and grounding utility, moving beyond just music into lifestyle.

* **Execution:** Pairing specific rhythms with natural phenomena (e.g., "Thunderstorm Didge", "Sunrise Grounding").
* **Cinematic Aesthetic:** Slow pans, high-fidelity nature integration, warm cinematic contrast.
* **Audio Treatment:** Deep low-end EQ, hypnotic rhythms, stable drone notes. Hypnotic resonance.
* **Hashtag Payload:** `#grounding`, `#soundhealing`, `#mentalclarity`, `#earthfrequency`, `#meditation`

## KINO-DB Execution Strategy & Pipeline Automation

When KINO-DB detects a new raw file in `RAW_VIDEO_DIR`, the following "Algorithmic Perfuming" occurs:

1. **Categorize Asset:** Identify if it is `ROOTS_`, `PROCS_`, or `MOOD_`.
2. **Apply The Grinder (Pipeline):**
   * *If `ROOTS_`:* Apply the high-impact **Neon Purple + Earth Tones** LUT. Optimize for high-retention fast cuts.
   * *If `PROCS_`:* Ensure instructional text overlays are perfectly timed.
   * *If `MOOD_`:* Maximize low frequencies. Apply slow, meditative pacing.
3. **Draft Narrative (via LEXIS integration):** Generate captions and optimized hooks.
4. **Push to Algorithm:** Authenticate and upload via TikTok Content Posting API. Monitor A/B hook win-rates.
