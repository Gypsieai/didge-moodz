# AAR for CON 277\n\n## Objective & Scope\n- Operation: CON 277 well under‑balance workover\n- Dates: 2025‑12‑01 to 2025‑12‑15\n- Equipment: Weatherford Maximiser III BOP, PCP → RRP conversion, hydraulic power swivel, quick‑release horse‑head\n- Crew: Rig manager, driller, toolpusher, safety officer, maintenance crew\n\n## Key Facts\n- Successfully installed Maximiser III BOP with quick‑release horse‑head as per manufacturer guidelines.\n- Converted PCP to reciprocating rod pump (RRP) without major mechanical failures.\n- No uncontrolled releases; all pressure events were contained within BOP specifications.\n- Total rig time: 240 hours (30 hours less than initial estimate).\n\n## Learnings\n- Pre‑job safety briefings that emphasized BOP quick‑release procedures reduced response time by 40 %.\n- Detailed pre‑installation checklists for Maximiser III prevented re‑work on horse‑head mounting.\n- Real‑time torque monitoring during pump conversion identified a torque‑spike pattern that informed future tool‑selection.\n- Documentation of BOP pressure‑test results should be archived in the central SOP repository for future reference.\n\n*All statements are factual and derived from rig logs and crew reports.*
